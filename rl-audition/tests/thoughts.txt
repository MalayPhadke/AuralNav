Thoughs that have come up during testing 


ROOMS
    - should we be using 3D rooms? Seems more realistic for simulating sound 
    - the shoebox rooms are just convex 2d rectangles
    - some of the polygon (rooms) generated are not convex
        - may want to add plotting code somewhere for helpful debugging 
        i.e. pra.Room.plot()

UTILS
    - choose_random_files randomly chooses male or female, so there may be just one gender
    - also default is 2 sources, but we can pass more
